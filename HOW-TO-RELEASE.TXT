#1. Trust info at http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html
2. Skip the maven release plugin; the ssh/github stuff isn't working for you.
3. Manually check in a non-snapshot pom and manually make a tag.
4. Use mvn clean deploy -P release to release a production version.

Or in words from the above url:

Develop, develop, develop
Commit any outstanding changes
Verify build passes
Update versions to release version
Commit release version
Run deployment
Update versions to next snapshot version
Commit new snapshot version
Develop, develop, develop and rinse and repeat
